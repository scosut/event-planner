# Event Planner

This application generates printable materials needed for an annual group trip. An event coordinator enters a list of attendees, assigns their seating graphically, then executes call to action to render the necessary place cards, table tents, and seating chart documents.

### Applied Technologies: 
- PHP and MySQL support CRUD operations. 
- MVC architecture provides file structure. 
- Third-party library implemented for PDF rendering. 
- JavaScript offers GUI for seat assignment.
